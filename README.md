# Data Science Job Salary Analysis in Excel

This GitHub repository contains an analysis of Data Science job salaries using Microsoft Excel. In this project, we explore the relationships between the type of experience, years of experience, and salary for data science professionals. Additionally, we calculate and visualize the average salary per employment type.

## Analysis Highlights:
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset is organized with columns for "Type of Experience," "Years of Experience," "Salary," and "Employment Type."

- **Average Salary per Employment Type**: We employ Excel's PivotTable feature to calculate and present the average salary per employment type, offering valuable insights into compensation trends.

- **Experience vs. Salary**: We create visual representations, such as histogram plots, line charts, pie charts, to help understand how years of experience relate to salary within the data science field.

- **VLOOKUP Function**: We use the VLOOKUP function to enhance the analysis by categorizing job records into different experience types, allowing for a deeper exploration of salary trends.

Feel free to explore the data, analysis, and visualizations in this repository to gain a better understanding of data science job salaries and employment trends.
